## 🚀 Getting Started

After installing from the Rocket.Chat Apps marketplace:

Type `/gag @username 5m reason` to gag a user for 5 minutes.

Type `/ungag @username` to ungag them

You can gag for any period of time and interval.

For example, 1y would be 1 year. 10m would be 10 minutes. 5d would be 5 days.

- y = years
- q = quarters
- mo = months
- w = weeks
- d = days
- h = hours
- m = minutes
